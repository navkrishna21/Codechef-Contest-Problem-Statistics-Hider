# Codechef Contest Problem Statistics Hider
Chrome Extension to hide the submissions and accuracy of problems in Codechef contests to save participants from demotivation

# Description

During the Codechef contests, the number of successful submissions and accuracy are displayed next to each problem.

If the number of successful submissions or the accuracy of the problems is very less, it becomes very demotivating for some participants and they approach the problems with a losing mentality.

Besides, such statistics do not pose any benefit in contests like the Codechef Long Challenge, which is a 10 day long monthly coding marathon.

To overcome this problem, I have built a chrome extension to hide these stats of all the problems. It will help people to freely attempt all the problems without worrying about the outcomes even before they attempt.

# Installation

1. After cloning the project, open the chrome browser and go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)
2. Turn on the Developer Mode
3. Click on Load Unpacked and select the folder where the project is cloned.
4. You will see the chrome extension in the browser toolbar.

# Usage

* Since the extension is a page action extension, it will only work on [codechef.com](https://www.codechef.com)
* Click on the extension for the popup with the Toggle button.
* You can enable and disable hiding the problem stats using the toggle button in the extension popup.
* The state of the toggle button is saved, hence you do not need to enable it again and again when you restart your browser.
* Go to any contest page of codechef.com. If the toggle button is enabled, you will see that the problem stats of all problems are hidden.
