# Codechef Contest Problem Statistics Hider
Chrome Extension to hide the submissions and accuracy of problems in Codechef contests to prevent participants from demotivation

# Description

During the Codechef contests, the number of successful submissions and accuracy are displayed next to each problem.

If the number of successful submissions or the accuracy of the problems are very less, it becomes very demotivating for some participants and they approach problems with a losing mentality.

Besides, such statistics do not pose any benefit in contests like Codechef Long Challenge, which is a 10 day long monthly coding marathon.

To overcome this problem, I have built a chrome extension to hide these stats of all the problems. It will help people to freely attempt all the problems without worrying about the outcomes even before they attempt.
