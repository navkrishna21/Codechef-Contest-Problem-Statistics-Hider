# Codechef Long Challenge Submissions Hider
Chrome Extension to hide the submissions of Codechef Long Challenge contest.

# Description
CodeChef Long Challenge is a 10-day monthly coding contest on codechef.com

During the contest, the number of successful submissions is displayed next to each problem. It represents the number of people having correctly solved that particular problem. 

If the number of successful submissions is very less, it becomes very demotivating for the participant and they approach problems with a losing mentality.

To overcome this, I am building a chrome extension to hide the submissions of all the problems. It will help people to freely attempt all the problems wthout worrying about the outcomes even before they attempt.
